## Project description

This project allows you to convert spoken commands from smart devices, like Amazon Echo and Google Assistant, into typed text or executable actions on your Windows computer. By integrating various software and services such as Push2Run, Pushbullet, and Python scripts, you can control your PC using voice commands.

### Background

This project originated from a simple desire to dictate to my computer, evolving into a quest for voice command functionality akin to my experience with an Android phone. While this project may not rival other solutions such as [Microsoft's voice access](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/get-started-with-voice-access-bd2aa2dc-46c2-486c-93ae-3d75f7d053a4), my approach is open source, highly customaizable, and enables remote control from your smart devices. So, it offers for some a more valuable experience.

## Prerequisites

All requirements are *FREE*[^1] or free to a certain extent.

- Windows PC
  - [Push2Run](https://www.push2run.com/) application
  - [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) module
  - [NirCmd](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) for audial responses (optional)[^3]
- [Pushbullet](https://www.Pushbullet.com/) account
- A smart home assistant device. These are two compatible options, AFAIK.
  - an Amazon Echo - **recommended**
    - with the [PC Commander](https://pccommander.net/) skill
  - a Google Assistant device
    - and an [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) account
      - with applicable applet(s)
> [!NOTE]
> Due to Google's August 2022 bull**** change, the IFTTT route no longer supports variables or "ingredients[^7]" in its commands so applets must be hard-coded.

## Setup
1. **Create Pushbullet Account**: Go to [pushbullet.com](https://www.pushbullet.com/).
1. **Install Push2Run**: Download and install the [Push2Run](https://www.push2run.com/) application on your Windows PC.
1. **Set Up Smart Device**: Connect your smart device to Pushbullet.
    - **Amazon Echo**: Use the [PC Commander skill](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFRQYYC3/) for integration.
    - **Google Assistant**: Use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to link Google Assistant with Pushbullet.
1. **Install Python and Dependencies**: Install Python 3.x, then the `pynput` module (by executing `pip install pynput` in a command line after installing Python).
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > It's recommended to select "Add python.exe to PATH". Otherwise, you must use the full python executable path in your Push2Run cards.
5. **Download Project Files**: Clone or download the project files, **along with NirCmd**, into `C:\Scripts\speech2input\` or a directory of your choosing.
  > [!NOTE]
  > You may place NirCmd elsewhere but you'll need to add its path to PATH. Alternatively, if executed directly, it'll offer you a button to copy it to your Windows directory.
6. **Configure Push2Run**: Link Push2Run with your Pushbullet account, and import the `p2r` file or create cards in Push2Run to link voice commands to Python scripts.<details><summary><strong>Instructions</strong></summary>
    - for **Amazon Echo** route: https://pccommander.net/howto/push2run/  
    - for **Google Assistant** route: https://github.com/roblatour/Push2Run/blob/main/help/setup_Google_IFTTT_Pushbullet.md
    </details>

> [!WARNING]
> If you chose a custom project directory and wish to import the `p2r` file, update the path of each entry's *Parameter* field to the directory you chose. This can be done either before importing with a text editor, or after importing within Push2Run's GUI.

|Action|Description|
|-|-|
|**Type \***            |Bypass command interpretation (uses `-v` flag) to simply type out the supplied text|
|**Computer! Do Things**|Attempts to interpret command as Windows action(s).|
|**Open \***            |Opens a program.|
|**Close \***           |Closes a program.|
|**Voice Typing**       |Opens Microsoft's dictation solution.|
|**Voice Access**       |Opens Microsoft's control solution.|
|**Voice Update**       |Opens Windows update.|
|**No matching phrases**|"*No matching phrases*" is a special catch-all phrase that's triggered when no other card was triggered. Functionality is same as the "*Computer! Do Things*" card.|

The first two cards use this project's python script(s). The rest are bonus useful cards.

By this point, your digital assistant should understand a certain invocation phrase to indicate to forward commands through your Pushbullet service which is then captured by Push2Run. There are a couple points to learn about Push2Run if you want to best harness it's power. In the following example scenarios, we'll use the invocation phrase "*tell my computer to* ~", the default for the Amazon Echo route, and which most colloquially makes sense.

- `$` represents your variable input.  For example, let's say you've setup your Type card just like in the `p2r` file, with "type $" as one of the 'Listen for' entries[^4] and `main.py -v "$"` in the parameters field.

    You say: "*tell my computer to* **type** it is a lovely day period mark"

    `main.py` receives `-v "it is a lovely day period mark"` (`-v` being the verbatim flag), then formats the string nicely, and lastly simulates the key presses to type out "**It is a lovely day.**" on your computer.

- Within the 'Listen for' field, the `*` is a throw-away, catch-all character. It's purpose is for matching miscellaneous phrases, not for capturing text.

  For example, let's say that you've put created a card specifically for modifying volume with "* volume $" in the 'Listen for' field, and `change_audio_volume.py "$"` in your Parameters field.
  1. You say: "*tell my computer to* lower the gosh darn **volume to 20 percent**"
  1. Push2Run will match and throw away "lower the gosh darn".
  1. Match the "**volume**" keyword to the card.
  1. And pass long "**to 20 percent**" to the script.

## How to use directly

Here's how to utilize these project files directly, without relying on Push2Run triggers.

- To type out a string to your computer with basic formatting use...

  `python main.py -v [<string>...]`

- To give your computer a command ([see supported commands](#list-of-viable-commands)) use...

  `python main.py [<command>...]`

> [!TIP]
> These commands will execute immediately so if you wish to type on or control a particular application, you will need to either execute the command in a hidden window or use a delay timer.

## List of viable commands

Please note the following

- You can chain commands together with delimiters "and", and "then".[^6]

- You can delay commands by saying a wait phrase along with your command. For example...
  - wait 10 minutes then type still working on it and hit send
  - press alt f4 in 5 minutes

- Although Google Assistant will sometimes properly insert punctuation in your speech, you must say "mark" or "sign" after punctuation.  For example...
  - "typing colon sign open parentheses sign words closed parentheses mark" -> "Typing : ( words )"

### Typing

To type out inputs, either use the `-v` flag with the command or start the command with the word `type`. Punctuation marks and new lines are supported. Additionally, inputs are generally formatted as a sentence. For example...

- "a phrase of your choice comma sign with punctuation exclamation mark" -> "A phrase of your choice , with punctuation !"
- "type i'll  be there at 6 pm period mark send" -> "I'll be there at 6 pm ." (Enter will be pressed afterwards)

## Caveats, acknowledgements, and known bugs to fix

- [ ] *An internet connection is required for your computer to recieve commands.*
- [ ] *You must be logged into your computer for most, if not all, actions to succeed.*
- [ ] A digital assistant's attention span is short. So, commands must be swift and to the point.
  - [ ] As such, performing multiple or complex actions utilizing this project may prove difficult.  Thankfully the Alexa method has a follow-up mode which alleviates this pressure.
- [ ] Giving literal key-press commands can be tricky to near impossible as it is wholly dependent on what the digital assistant *thinks* it heard with their tendency to listen for natural spoken language.  For example, it may hear "end" when you say "n".  I try to work with this by providing an equivalency dictionary but it isn't perfect.
- [ ] Log file location may differ depending on whether the script is executed from the console[^5] or by Push2Run.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Aside from the Windows PC and a device with smart home assistant, of course.  These devices are ubiquitous but I recognize accessibility to these devices is not universal.
[^3]: Currently, audial responses are only used to confirm volume adjustments and to inform the user when a command was not understood.
[^4]: You can list multiple "Listen for" phrases.  Be sparing here as the more variability you add, the greater your chances of stepping on another card's toes, leading to unexpected results.
[^6]: Actually by default, Push2Run also uses "and" and "then" as a delimiter to se qparate commands.  Given that the setting may interfere with this project's and/then function, you may find it useful to remove the delimiters from Push2Run's settings: File > Options > Separating words.
[^7]: Fucking stupid name for it.
