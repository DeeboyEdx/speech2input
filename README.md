This project came about because I wanted to be able to give my *Windows* computer voice commands like I do my Android phone.
Using a number of free tools, I succeeded in creating something functional with python.

# Requirements
- [Google](https://www.gmail.com) account w/ Google Assistant
- [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) account
- [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) account
- Windows PC
- [Push2Run](https://www.push2run.com/) program
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) module. TL:DR  `pip install pynput`
  - and perhaps other non-standard modules (TBD)

# Setup

Follow these steps to setup the connection from Google Assistant to Push2Run.  https://www.push2run.com/setup_pushbullet.html

Once you have that connection functioning, you can create the following card(s) to facilitate the voice commands on your PC.
