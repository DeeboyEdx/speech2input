# Summray

This project came about because I wanted to be able to give my computer voice commands like I do my Android phone.

Using a number of free tools out there, which I will list in more detail later, I succeeded to a certain satisfying degree.
This script uses...
- Google Assistant
- If This Then That
- Pushbullet
- Push2Run
- Python
  - pynput module
  - and perhaps other non-standard modules (TBD)

More details to come.
